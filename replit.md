## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Flask-based architecture with the following key components:

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with PostgreSQL support via environment variables
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with session management
- **File Processing**: Modular utility system for different tool categories
- **API Design**: RESTful API with Blueprint-based route organization

### Frontend Architecture
- **Core Technologies**: Modern HTML5, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI components
- **Interactivity**: Alpine.js for reactive components
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons for consistent UI elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dark mode support
- **Animations**: Animate.css for smooth transitions

### Database Schema
The system uses SQLAlchemy models with the following key entities:
- **User**: Firebase UID, email, display name, theme preferences
- **ToolHistory**: User activity tracking for analytics
- **SavedFile**: File metadata and storage tracking
- **ToolCategory**: Tool categorization and organization

## Key Components

### 1. Tool Processing System
- **Modular Design**: Each tool category has dedicated utility modules
- **File Handlers**: Centralized file upload, validation, and cleanup
- **Processing Queue**: Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- **Format Support**: Extensive file format support across categories

### 2. User Management
- **Firebase Integration**: OAuth providers (Google, email/password)
- **Session Management**: Server-side session handling
- **User Preferences**: Theme, language, and personalization settings
- **Usage Analytics**: Tool usage tracking and history

### 3. Tool Categories
- **PDF Toolkit**: 15 tools (merge, split, compress, convert, etc.)
- **Image Toolkit**: 15 tools (compress, resize, convert, OCR, etc.)
- **Video & Audio**: 10 tools (trim, convert, extract audio, etc.)
- **AI Tools**: Resume generation, text processing, etc.
- **Government Documents**: India-specific document tools
- **Additional Categories**: Text, QR codes, utilities

### 4. File Management
- **Upload System**: Drag-and-drop with file validation
- **Temporary Storage**: Local processing with automatic cleanup
- **Size Limits**: Configurable file size restrictions (16MB default)
- **Security**: Filename sanitization and MIME type validation

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Firebase handles OAuth, server creates/updates user records
2. **Tool Selection**: Users browse categorized tools with search functionality
3. **File Upload**: Client-side validation, server-side processing
4. **Processing**: Queued processing with progress tracking
5. **Download**: Temporary URLs for processed files
6. **Cleanup**: Automatic file cleanup after processing
7. **Analytics**: Usage tracking for popular tools and user insights

- **DaisyUI**: Component library
- **Alpine.js**: Reactive frontend framework
- **Lucide Icons**: Icon library
- **Animate.css**: CSS animations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Flask development server with SQLite
- **Hot Reload**: Debug mode enabled for rapid development
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration via .env files

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production workloads
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with cleanup processes
- **Security**: Environment-based secrets management
