# URGENT: Fix Firebase Authentication Domain Error

## THE PROBLEM
Your Firebase authentication is failing because your current Replit domain is not authorized in Firebase Console.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### 1. Find Your Current Domain
Look at your browser's address bar. It should show something like:
- `https://[some-random-id].replit.dev`
- `https://[your-repl-name]--[username].replit.dev`

### 2. Add This Domain to Firebase Console
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
4. Click **"Add domain"**
5. Add your exact domain (without https://):
   - Example: `d54d1cce1363.replit.dev`
   - Also add: `*.replit.dev` (if available)

### 3. Wait and Test
- Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to take effect
- Try Google sign-in again
- Email/password should work immediately

## WHAT I'VE ALREADY FIXED
✅ Installed Firebase Admin SDK
✅ Enhanced error handling
✅ Proper token verification
✅ Database user creation
✅ Session management
✅ Better error messages

## AUTHENTICATION SHOULD WORK AFTER DOMAIN FIX
- Email/password registration ✅
- Email/password login ✅
- Google sign-in ✅ (after domain authorization)
- Password reset ✅
- User session management ✅

## IF STILL HAVING ISSUES
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Try clearing browser cache
3. Verify Firebase project settings
